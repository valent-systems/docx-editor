'@eigenpal/docx-editor-core': patch

Preserve block-level bookmarks and text-box text on save. Bookmarks (`w:bookmarkStart`/`w:bookmarkEnd`) placed between block elements — in the body, table cells, headers/footers, or content controls — are no longer dropped when a document is opened and saved, so cross-references, hyperlinks and table-of-contents entries that point at them keep working. Text inside shapes/text boxes whose geometry is not exactly `textBox` (e.g. `rect` AlternateContent fallbacks) is also preserved instead of being discarded.
